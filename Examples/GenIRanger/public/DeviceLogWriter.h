/** Upon creation this class registers a callback to LogMessageEventID in order
    to know when a new log message has been pushed into the device node map.
    It will read LogMessageText, LogMessageLevel and LogMessageTimestamp and
    output their values to a log file specified in constructor.

    A prerequisite for this class to work is to attach the node map to a
    GenApi::EventAdapterGEV. It will take a GenTL event buffer and extract its
    contents into the node map.

    The log has a limit to it, when this is reached it will be 'copied' by
    being renamed with the added suffix '-backup'. It will then continue
    logging to a new file with the original path.
